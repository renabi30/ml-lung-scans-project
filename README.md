#**Respiratory Disease Detection with Convolutional Neural Networks: How to Run Code**

The Python Notebook is structured as a walkthrough of our entire project process, from data loading and preprocessing to developing and training models to performing additional experiments to results & discussion.

Each cell is meant to be ran in the order they are presented. Run the initial import cells and all cells in the Datsets/Pre-Processing sections to load, process, and store all image
data in training-validation-test sets. Run all the cells in the Methods section to define our CNN models, train and evaluate them, select the best model, and perform additional tasks/experiments such as hyperparameter tuning,
data transformation and retraining of the best model, and comparing the best model to SVM/Random Forest classifiers. Lastly, run all the cells in the Interpretability seciton
to produce visualizations of feature maps, best model structure, and heatmaps to help understand the interpretability of our best CNN model.
